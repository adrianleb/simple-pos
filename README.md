Simple POS Challenge
-----------------------------------
due to circunstances, this was done as simple as possible


## How to

### Run
 - copy and paste the contents of the .js file in your browser terminal

### Docs
 The API is fairly simple:
 - init() : 'boots' the POS
 - reset() : resets price and products
 - scanProduct(key) : adds a product
 - total:Float : total price
